# Comparative-Bacterial-Genomics

Comparative bacterial genomics involves the study of the genomic content of different bacterial strains or species to understand their evolutionary relationships, identify genetic diversity, and explore the functional implications of genomic variations. The step-by-step workflow for performing comparative genomics analysis between two bacterial strains involves :
1. Genome Sequencing
2. Genome Assembly
3. Assembly polishing / Gap Filling
4. Functional Annotation
5. Comparative Genomics
6. Pan Genome Analysis
7.
